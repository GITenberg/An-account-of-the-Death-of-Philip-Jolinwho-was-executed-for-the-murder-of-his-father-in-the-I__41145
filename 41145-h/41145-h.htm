iii</span>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>
<p>To determine the real state of mind in a criminal manifesting,
for the first time, when under sentence of death, signs of
repentance, is plainly a work of much difficulty.&nbsp; If ever
dissimulation may be expected, it must be in the case of a person
probably long habituated, and, in his present circumstances,
additionally excited to it by the fear of death: and the
experience of every minister of religion conversant in such
cases, must teach him that professions of religion, under such
circumstances, are far oftener the language of alarm, than of
real conversion.&nbsp; Every one, therefore, would earnestly
covet, with Mr. Newton, to know rather how the man lived, than
how he had died.&nbsp; But here the life and the death may offer
the most conflicting evidence.&nbsp; How difficult it is then so
to decide as not, on the one hand, to make &ldquo;the heart of
the righteous sad, whom God has not made sad;&rdquo; upon the
other, to say &ldquo;peace&rdquo; to the soul, &ldquo;when there
is no peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most of the cases of religious communication with dying
criminals, recorded in the public prints, are in the highest
degree painful.&nbsp; The chaplain goes through the forms of
instruction, the sermon is preached, and then, without one proof
being assigned of the fitness of the criminal for that solemn
ordinance of religion, the sacrament is administered.&nbsp; All
the requisitions of our church, as to &ldquo;those who come to
the Lord&rsquo;s supper,&rdquo; are passed by.&nbsp; The deep
workings of repentance, and longing for amendment, the exercise
of a lively faith in Christ, the thankful remembrance of his
death, the feeling of universal charity so difficult <a
name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. iv</span>in such
circumstances; in short, every evidence of an awakened and
converted heart is neglected, and the man forced upon a
hypocritical avowal of truth, to which he is in reality utterly a
stranger.&nbsp; He dies, in fact, with &ldquo;a lie in his right
hand&rdquo;&mdash;a lie, the guilt of which is surely divided
between himself and the minister who urges him to the rash
reception of the sacrament.</p>
<p>It is under the deepest conviction of the difficulty of such
cases, that the present tract, recording the events of the last
eleven days in the life of a criminal is presented to the
public.&nbsp; His crimes had been great, but hypocrisy was not
amongst their number.&nbsp; His faculties were not such as to
give him any peculiar facility in adopting the truths presented
to him.&nbsp; He had received no previous religious
instruction.&nbsp; He had no uncommon power of utterance.&nbsp;
Let the reader judge whether the words and conduct, both before
and after conviction, as recorded in these pages, do not supply
an evidence of the power of God to reclaim the wanderer even in
the eleventh hour; and are not calculated, in the highest degree,
to encourage the often disconsolate visitor of the sick, the
dying, and the criminal.&nbsp; The facts here recorded have been
collected partly by personal communication, partly from letters
to the writer from the Rev. W. C. Hall, and partly from a printed
account of the Rev. E. Durell.&nbsp; The substance of the
statement was first inserted in the Christian Observer, and it is
now submitted, with some alteration, to the public, and with an
earnest desire that its perusal may, through the Divine blessing,
tend to the glory of that compassionate Saviour, to whose service
it is dedicated.</p>

class="GutSmall">THE</span><br />
LAST DAYS OF PHILIP JOLIN,<br />
<span class="GutSmall">LATELY EXECUTED AT ST. HELENS,</span><br
/>
<span class="GutSmall">FOR</span><br />
THE MURDER OF HIS FATHER.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> particulars of the crime of
this unfortunate young man may be stated in a few words.&nbsp; He
had long been known in the neighbourhood where he lived, as an
object of disgrace, and the cause of perpetual disturbance.&nbsp;
Not indeed that he was more profligate in character than those
with whom he was immediately connected.&nbsp; His father, as well
as his mother-in-law, lived in habits of drunkenness.&nbsp; She
died eight months before the son committed the crime for which he
suffered.&nbsp; Jolin was, with his father, by trade a
blacksmith.&nbsp; His business brought with it some temptation to
drinking; and, in Jersey, where spirits are cheaper even than in
England, this disposition was most easily gratified.&nbsp; So
that, with the example of his parents, and his own circumstances,
it is not a matter of astonishment that he fell into the course
of sin which led to his ruin.&nbsp; The progress of vice was, it
is to be presumed, in his case, like that of other
drunkards.&nbsp; The liquor, at first taken as a bodily relief,
unguarded by any restraint, was soon resorted to as an
indulgence; till at last he was enlisted in the number of those
of whom the <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>prophet speaks, &ldquo;who rise up in the morning that
they may follow their drink, and continue till night, till wine
inflames them.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the abominable tendency of this
particular sin is illustrated almost equally by the conduct of
the father and son.</p>
<p>It appeared on the trial of Jolin, that he had been exposed to
the greatest cruelties on the part of his father.&nbsp; One
person deposed, that he had often seen him beat his son with a
hammer, or any thing else, which might happen to come under his
hand, and almost always about the head; and the scars from these
wounds were seen on his head when he was committed to
prison.&nbsp; Another, that she had once heard the
prisoner&rsquo;s mother cry out for help.&nbsp; She went in, and
saw the son down, and the father striking him with an iron bar,
saying at the same time, that he was going to kill him.&nbsp;
Very often he would not give him any food.&nbsp; Another witness
testified, that, going into the house of the father, he saw him
put down a flat iron bar, with which he had just been striking
his son on the head, and his head was covered with blood.&nbsp;
He was laid on his bed, but his father refused to allow any
assistance to be tendered to him.&nbsp; This witness had seen the
father kick his son about several parts of the body.&nbsp; What a
contrast is all this to that scene which the psalmist describes
of a household where the Spirit of God
dwells&mdash;&ldquo;Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for
brethren to dwell together in unity, for there the Lord
commandeth his blessing.&rdquo;&nbsp; These facts are introduced,
not only in explanation of the subject, but that some light may
be thrown on the appeal which Jolin afterwards made to his judge
on his own behalf.</p>
<p>On the morning on which the last crime was committed, as Jolin
confessed to one who attended upon him in prison, he had drank to
excess, and become completely intoxicated.&nbsp; In this state he
returned to his own home&mdash;a home of which, he added,
&ldquo;no one knew the wretchedness.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was dinner
time, but he found no food prepared, and from his father he met
with only that reception which he might expect from such a
parent; more <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>especially when he himself was overcome with
drunkenness.&nbsp; He went into the garden to gather a pear, and
about this the fatal quarrel ensued.&nbsp; The father had come
behind, and caught him by the cape of the jacket, and kicked him
about the back and legs.&nbsp; He tore himself from his father,
and was soon seen running out of the house crying, and the father
in the act of pursuing, as if with the intention of striking
him.&nbsp; The father said that he would &ldquo;settle him when
he returned.&rdquo;&nbsp; The son replied, that he would
&ldquo;settle him (the father) also.&rdquo;&nbsp; The son then
ran to a heap of bricks which lay in the street, and taking one
which he appears to have broken in two pieces, he returned to be
revenged on his father.&nbsp; He was remonstrated with by a
neighbour, but in vain.&nbsp; In his rage he threw the brickbats
at his father.&nbsp; One of the pieces struck him on the head,
and he immediately fell to the ground.&nbsp; The wretched
sufferer swooned from the violence of the blow and the loss of
blood.&nbsp; In this state he appears to have remained, with very
little change, for about an hour, when he died.&nbsp; It is not
stated whether he was enabled to cry for mercy to that God, into
whose presence he was thus awfully hurried; or whether he had
time to reflect upon the state of his son, and his probable
punishment.&nbsp; How awful must have been the change to this
wretched man, when he found himself in a moment lifting up his
eyes before the Judge of quick and dead!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the son, utterly unconscious of what he had done,
or feeling only satisfaction at what he thought was the suitable
punishment for his father, went out again, and finding his way
into a neighbour&rsquo;s shop, told the keeper of it that his
father had beaten him, and that he had knocked him down.&nbsp;
Here he fell asleep, and slept probably till his fit of
intoxication had passed away.&nbsp; On rising he was about
quietly and unsuspectingly to return to the scene of his crime,
when he was arrested and brought to prison.&nbsp; When, on the
way to the prison, he was told that his conduct might possibly
bring him to the gallows, he showed his first symptom of
alarm.&nbsp; He remained in prison till Thursday, September 24,
when he <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>was
submitted to his first public examination.&nbsp; The trial,
according to the laws of that country, was repeated on Monday the
28th.&nbsp; The judges, and two juries, in number together
thirty-seven, after the fullest investigation of the facts, and
after hearing the able defence of his advocate, Mr. Hammond,
pronounced his crime to be murder, and condemned him to
death.&nbsp; The court refused even to make application for the
mitigation of punishment, whereupon he was delivered to the
execution of his sentence, which he underwent on Saturday, Oct.
3d.</p>
<p>There were many particulars in this case, in addition to the
remarkable nature of the crime, and indeed the rareness of any
crime of such magnitude in the small district in which it
occurred, that made it a subject of very general notice.&nbsp;
One leading circumstance was the manifest alteration which took
place in Jolin&rsquo;s mind during the period of his
imprisonment.&nbsp; Upon this point there was an entire agreement
of opinion amongst all persons who had any acquaintance with the
real state of the case.&nbsp; Not only ministers, both of the
church and the Dissenters, but persons of other classes, bore
testimony to the reality of <i>a</i> change; the <i>nature</i> of
which, however, not so many persons could detect, as its very
striking effects.&nbsp; The newspaper spoke of an
&ldquo;alteration&rdquo; which took place in him, of his
&ldquo;confession, in the most humble terms, of his own
sinfulness;&rdquo; of &ldquo;his forcible admonitions to others
to abstain from evil, and to practise the duties of religion and
morality;&rdquo; but of the change of heart which this case
exhibited, the editor of the paper seems to have had no real
understanding.&nbsp; The case of Jolin, convinced of his sin,
however, is that of a man, not merely convinced of his guilt in
one instance, and anxious to warn others not converted by the
Holy Ghost, acknowledging his total alienation of heart from God,
and persuaded that all his repentance, all his good resolutions,
could never expiate his past sins; but that, as he himself said,
&ldquo;Christ was his only hope; for <span
class="smcap">He</span> had paid his ransom, and He would receive
him into glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The greater part of persons who have had much experience <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>in visiting the
dying sick, or condemned criminals, have, in general, little
confidence in a repentance which only springs up under the
apprehension of immediate death, whatever flights of sentiment
may be exhibited.&nbsp; They have seen in the backsliding of men
who promised every thing in the time of sickness, how vain,
generally speaking, are the convictions of their sincerity.&nbsp;
In the greater part of these cases, there is a want of
completeness in the work of repentance and faith, which the
experienced pastoral visitor is often able to detect; too little
of real contrition, or too much of profession and
confidence.&nbsp; But in the case in question, those who visited
Jolin confess themselves to have been impressed, as they might
conceive the spectators to be affected by the case of the thief
on the cross.&nbsp; One and all were led to say, &ldquo;this is
the finger of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Under such circumstances, it
cannot surely be wrong to gather together a few particulars of
this history, which will be interesting to those, at least, who
have experienced the power of divine grace in their own change of
heart, and who rejoice in every display of it in the sinner that
repenteth.</p>
<p>Jolin appears in early life to have been sent to school,
although he said, that such had been the irregularity of his
father&rsquo;s house, and such the hindrances thrown in his way,
that he had been more impeded than encouraged by his parents, in
any attempt to attend upon the public means of religious
instruction.&nbsp; How tremendous is the responsibility of such a
father and mother; culpable in their neglect, but awfully so in
their example!&nbsp; And what a case is here presented of the
retributive justice of God!&nbsp; The father trained his child in
habits of intoxication, and treated him with cruel violence; and
the son, in a fit of intoxication, by an act of violence, hurried
his father headlong to the bar of God&rsquo;s judgment.&nbsp; We
are not able, often, so clearly to trace the workings of Almighty
wrath; nor is it to be expected, that, placed as we are in a
state in which we must look for our rewards or punishments beyond
the grave, we should here see any proportionate recompense of
crime.&nbsp; Still we know, that &ldquo;as a man sows <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>so he shall
also reap,&rdquo; if not in this world, to bring him to
repentance, yet certainly, and how much more awfully! in that
world where a place for repentance is no where found.</p>
<p>This young man, on some occasions previous to his committal to
prison, had read the Bible; for he remarked to one of his
attendants, that when at sea, during his watch, he had done so;
but he added, &ldquo;I then read it as a sealed book.&nbsp; I had
neither eyes given me to see, nor ears to hear, and this was a
just judgment upon me for my sins.&rdquo;&nbsp; His mode of life
had, indeed, been one of complete dissoluteness.&nbsp; He went to
sea, because he was too bad to remain on land; and he returned to
shore, probably because he was wearied of the restraints at
sea.&nbsp; The relations of the family, disgusted at the scenes
of vice in his father&rsquo;s house, abandoned them.&nbsp; So
that it is not easy to conceive a state of lower degradation than
this young man had reached.&nbsp; No one, as he himself said,
could describe the misery of this state as he had experienced
it.&nbsp; What situation could indeed more completely tend to
brutalize the mind, to deaden every feeling of conscience, to
leave the man long habituated to it &ldquo;without hope,&rdquo;
and indeed &ldquo;without God in the world?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
nature of the crime for which Jolin was committed to prison, was
such as to increase the general horror against him.&nbsp; This
was exhibited by the crowd, in the streets, on the occasion of
his trial; so that his various crimes had made him an outcast
from the pity and compassion of his fellow-creatures.&nbsp; It is
true, there were particular circumstances in his case, which, if
generally known, would have lessened the public indignation, and
which might have been a source of secret satisfaction to
himself.&nbsp; These were the exceeding badness of his education,
the brutality of his father, the continual discord of his family,
the state of intoxication in which he was when he unintentionally
committed the crime; but these points, although once alluded to
in his appeal to his judges, were scarcely mentioned by him in
his private conversations, so completely was the conviction
established in his mind, that he had <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>fallen into sin by the wilfulness of
his own heart, that he had destroyed himself; and that to a
greater depth of transgression he could scarcely have
reached.</p>
<p>After Jolin had been lodged in gaol, he was visited by a very
respectable relative, Mr. Pinel, a member of the Methodist
church.&nbsp; He made this visit, as he himself testified,
without the hope of any spiritual benefit.&nbsp; He, however,
desired to relieve his temporal necessities, and to afford him
all the comfort in his power.&nbsp; He found the poor culprit in
a most pitiable state.&nbsp; Overwhelmed and stunned by his
situation, he was lying on a heap of straw, and appeared like one
who had no hope to look to in this world, or the next.&nbsp; Mr.
Pinel said to him, &ldquo;Young man, I think both your body and
your soul are in great danger.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jolin did not answer,
but sobbed excessively.&nbsp; He then procured for him a bed, and
some comfortable clothing, and put into his hands a French
Testament.&nbsp; Soon after, as there was at that time no
chaplain regularly appointed to the gaol, Jolin was visited by
the curate of the parish, M. Falle.&nbsp; After some days, M.
Falle&rsquo;s great occupation in his ministry led him to
transfer this important and interesting charge to the Rev. W. C.
Hall, a young clergyman residing in the island, who took the more
immediate care of him, watched over, instructed, and finally
attended him through the dark valley of the shadow of death, till
he reached, as I doubt not, the portal of the heavenly
abode.&nbsp; Meanwhile the Testament was not neglected by
Jolin.&nbsp; He read it nearly through; but, in the first
instance, it would seem, without understanding the nature of the
message which it was designed to convey.&nbsp; His mind, however,
was no doubt gradually preparing by the Holy Spirit to receive
the instruction about to be more fully imparted.&nbsp; On the 22d
of September, about ten days before his execution, Jolin was
visited by Mr. Hall and another clergyman.&nbsp; He was then
sitting in his bed, and looking as wretched as might be expected
under the circumstances in which he was placed; as Mr. Pinel had
stated, &ldquo;without hope for this world, or the
next.&rdquo;&nbsp; They immediately entered upon the object of
their visit, and <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>spoke to him of the nature of his offence; of the sin of
murder, as condemned by the law of God, and aggravated in his
case, because committed against a parent; of its sentence in the
judgment of men, and its heinousness in the sight of God.&nbsp;
They pointed out to him, that, awful as is man&rsquo;s sentence
against this crime, little consideration was due to this in
comparison with the condemnation which the law of God pronounced;
and that this condemnation had passed upon him, and that the
execution of its sentence of eternal death would be inflicted if
he did not repent, and seek help and pardon through Jesus
Christ.&nbsp; All this was manifest, for it was written in the
word of God, that murderers should have their part in the lake
which burneth with fire and brimstone (Rev. xxi. 8;) that
drunkards should not inherit the kingdom of God, (1 Cor. vi. 10:)
and this condemnation, it was also pointed out, extended not only
to these crimes, but to that of the general sin of the heart, and
was the necessary consequence of its separation and alienation
from God.&nbsp; That this condemnation would come upon all
sinners was evident, for it is written, &ldquo;The wages of sin
is death,&rdquo; (Rom. vi. 23.)&nbsp; One point appeared
particularly to produce the deepest sensation of pain in this
young man&rsquo;s mind; this was the representation of the
conduct of God towards him in reference to his father; that
whilst that unhappy man had been cut off, and sent almost without
warning, with all his sins upon him, before the Judge who will
deal with every man according to his works, he, the murderer, had
been spared, and brought into a prison, where he had opportunity
given him to reflect upon his state, to seek for pardon, and
where salvation was offered to him, if he would turn and seek
it.&nbsp; The cry of, &ldquo;Oh my father, my poor father!&rdquo;
mingled with his sobs on that occasion.</p>
<p>Although Jolin&rsquo;s crime was so palpable, and was
confessed by him in the fullest, yet as it was committed
unconsciously, and he had seen no traces of it, except in what
others told him, the whole seemed like a dream; and the deed
itself, with its appalling circumstances, were not likely to
fasten themselves on his mind as if it had been <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>premeditated,
or as if he had been in full possession of his understanding, or
as if he, which he himself wished, had seen his father&rsquo;s
murdered corpse.&nbsp; However, this circumstance afterwards
appeared to turn out to his advantage.&nbsp; It prevented him
from fixing his thoughts exclusively on a particular sin; and he
was thus less hindered in discovering the sinfulness of his
nature and of his general habits, and learning the lesson it is
often so difficult to comprehend, that we are not less condemned
by the law of God for our general alienation from him, than for
any one or more scandalous offences which we may have
committed.&nbsp; Not that this state of mind in Jolin prevented
him from coming to the deepest sense of his own particular
offence; for as he learned more thoroughly to understand the
nature of sin in general, his feeling for his peculiar crime more
deeply penetrated his soul.&nbsp; One other subject seemed to
produce in him the same intense state of feeling which the
mention of his father had done; this was the sin of intemperance,
which had, as I have before remarked, been the immediate cause of
his crime.&nbsp; Mr. Hall, thinking that he might be suffering
from the cold, confined as he was in a large stone-chamber, of
which the window was usually open, guarded him against seeking a
refuge from his sufferings from drinking.&nbsp; At the mention of
this, he went off again into expressions of horror at the
supposed possibility of such an offence in his tremendous
circumstances, and declared that nothing should again tempt him
thus to transgress.&nbsp; Yet, as Mr. Hall observes, were his
resolutions expressed rather as if smarting under the penalty of
his crime, than as if conscious of his own inability to keep the
engagement which he was entering into.&nbsp; He spoke as a man
strong in his own strength, and as yet unacquainted with the
perfect weakness of resolution not formed in dependence upon the
power of God.</p>
<p>On the point of again falling into the sins of which he seemed
to have repented, three distinct states were noticed in
Jolin&rsquo;s case before his execution.&nbsp; At first, as at
this visit, he was fully confident that, if he were once <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>more to be
set at liberty, he should never again become intoxicated.&nbsp;
Afterwards, when he came to discover the exceeding weakness of
his nature, he even dreaded the possibility of his life being
accorded to him, lest he should again fall into temptation.&nbsp;
And, lastly, he learned to believe, that having cast himself
entirely upon Divine grace, and, therefore, using those means of
watchfulness and prayer which the word of God prescribes, he
needed not fear, if he were called again to life, the temptation
even to those vices to which he had been most habituated.&nbsp;
On the occasion of this visit, the fifty-first Psalm was pointed
out to him.&nbsp; It was in the Prayer-book version, as there was
no Bible at hand.&nbsp; This Psalm, so remarkably calculated to
meet the experience of a man feeling deeply his sins, and more
particularly of one implicated as he was in such a variety of
vice, struck his attention very deeply; and the more so when, the
next day, it was read to him in the Bible translation, and its
chief points expounded to him.&nbsp; He learned a great part of
this Psalm by heart; it was nearly the last portion of Scripture
that he repeated; and it became one of the subjects of his
meditation during the long nights in which he was shut up
alone.</p>
<p>The next day, the 23d, two or three passages of Scripture were
introduced to his notice; besides which a fuller view was
presented to him of the nature and consequences of sin.&nbsp; On
this occasion he was taught in what manner sin is the defilement
of the whole heart; that even the sins of his youth brought him
just as much into condemnation before a holy God as his one great
crime; that eternal death was the wages of every transgression of
the Divine law; and that repentance unto life required not only a
feeling of sorrow for one sin, but for every sin, yea, for sin
itself, as an offence against the Almighty.&nbsp; The promises of
God to the chief of sinners were then pointed out him from Isa.
i. 18, that &ldquo;though his sins were as scarlet, they might be
made white as snow;&rdquo; and from Isa. lv. 6, 7, that &ldquo;if
the wicked forsook his way, and returned unto the Lord, he would
have mercy, and abundantly <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>pardon.&rdquo;&nbsp; The former of
these passages remained fixed in his memory, and was a continual
source of consolation to his mind.&nbsp; He now began to feel
that his sins were as scarlet, and to desire earnestly to be
pardoned.&nbsp; Two other passages were also at that time
referred to, and enlarged upon.&nbsp; The first of these was John
iii. 14, 15.&nbsp; &ldquo;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the
wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that
whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have
everlasting life.&rdquo;&nbsp; This type presenting so remarkable
an image of the Lord Jesus Christ lifted up to bear the sins of
his people, and affording a remedy to those who really believe in
Him, was peculiarly calculated to meet his case: and he was
further taught from it, that as this people, if they had rather
chosen to trust to other remedies, or had refused to look at the
brazen serpent, or had spent their time in mourning over their
maladies, instead of doing as they were commanded, would never
have been healed; so if the sinner does not look to Christ, there
is no hope for him.&nbsp; One other important lesson was also
gathered from this subject; namely, that &ldquo;if a serpent had
bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he
lived;&rdquo; and in like manner, &ldquo;Whosoever believeth on
Jesus Christ shall not perish, but have eternal
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jolin was thus instructed in the mode of
pardon before God, through the merits of Jesus Christ; and in the
efficacy of this remedy, the universality of it to all that
believe, and the nature of faith, the means by which it can alone
be appropriated.</p>
<p>The last passage referred to was the history of the Scape
goat, contained in Lev. xvi.&nbsp; In this history we find that
Aaron, whilst the people afflicted their souls, (ver. 29,) laid
both his hands on the head of the live goat, and confessed on him
all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their
transgressions, putting them upon the head of the goat, and that
the goat bore away with him all their iniquities into a land not
inhabited.&nbsp; The illustration of this subject, and its
application to Jolin&rsquo;s own case, were very obvious.&nbsp;
The people &ldquo;afflicting their soul,&rdquo; denoted the state
in which every sinner must present <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>himself before God&mdash;for it is
the broken and the contrite heart which God will not despise; the
&ldquo;confession of sin&rdquo; on the head of the goat pointed
out the first and necessary duty of the returning
penitent&mdash;for &ldquo;if we say that we have no sin we
deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us; but if we confess
our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins:&rdquo;
the laying the sins upon the head of the goat exhibited the act
of faith, by which the condemnation of the sinner is transferred
to his atoning sacrifice; and the leading away the goat into the
wilderness, the full, perfect, and eternal pardon promised in the
Gospel, of every sin to every repenting sinner.</p>
<p>Although Jolin was not a person of uncommon capacity, and
although these passages of Scripture seemed to be new to him, yet
he apprehended them in a manner which gave just indication that
his heart was under the Divine teaching.&nbsp; It is said, Isa.
liv. 13, &ldquo;All thy children shall be taught of the
Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; This state of teachableness now seemed to have
been produced in this poor young man.&nbsp; The power of God had
made his heart <i>willing</i>, Ps. cx. 3; and he came very soon
to understand the truths by which he might be saved.&nbsp; When
the will of man is not disposed to submit to God, every doctrine
of the Gospel presents difficulties; one point is unreasonable,
another impossible, a third useless; but when the mind is taught
of God, it is astonishing how soon all these difficulties
vanish.&nbsp; The doctrines of the Gospel, which seem the most
hard to understand and to receive, are at once
comprehended.&nbsp; It is like a change from darkness to
light.&nbsp; The passages of Scripture which teach the sinfulness
of our own nature, the worth of a Saviour, the nature of faith,
the pleasantness of religion, the delight attendant upon dwelling
with God, are at once received and adopted; and the whole system
of Christianity is discovered to be one exactly suited to the
sinner&rsquo;s own state.&nbsp; But the willingness of heart
which is necessary to a right reception of religion, we are every
where in Scripture taught, is the gift of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;
It cometh &ldquo;not of blood,&rdquo; that is, from our parents;
&ldquo;nor of the will of the flesh,&rdquo; that <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>is, by our
own natural inclination; &ldquo;nor of the will of man,&rdquo;
that is, by the teaching of others; &ldquo;but of
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The wind bloweth where it listeth, and
thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it
cometh and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the
Spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp; We see then how necessary it is that, if any
man &ldquo;lack wisdom,&rdquo; he should &ldquo;ask it of
God;&rdquo; and so much the more, as our Lord himself declares,
Luke xi. 13, his desire to give his Holy Spirit to them that ask
him.</p>
<p>The 24th was the day of Jolin&rsquo;s first trial, at the
close of which he was found guilty.&nbsp; Some of his friends,
whom he had asked to go to him, went after the trial.&nbsp; They
expected to find him, on this occasion, in some degree disturbed
and agitated in mind; but it was altogether otherwise.&nbsp; The
irons to which he was sentenced were put on him in their
presence.&nbsp; To this, as the natural consequence of his
condemnation, he submitted almost without notice.&nbsp; Indeed,
the trial and the condemnation itself seem to have made little or
no impression upon him; for it was only by minute and repeated
inquiry as to the proceedings of the day, that visitors could
obtain from him any account of them.&nbsp; His mind seemed
absorbed in something else; and what this was, afterwards
appeared.&nbsp; His conduct, during his trial, had been remarked
by many of his judges, as entirely suitable to his awful
situation.&nbsp; Indeed, his whole frame of mind was now
beginning to discover the influence of a new principle, and to
show that the great work of regeneration was taking place.&nbsp;
In the early part of his confinement, and indeed very recently,
he had wished, as he might naturally, for his escape; and his cry
to his advocate had been, &ldquo;Save me from the gallows;&rdquo;
but at this period, the desire that his life might be spared,
seemed to be taken away from him in a most astonishing
degree.&nbsp; It was not so with the very zealous and able
advocate to whom his cause had been committed, and who very
properly continued to the end, to urge every plea, and to
encourage his client to every effort, by which his punishment
might be remitted, or even delayed.&nbsp; His friends too were
most kindly anxious on this point; and they even <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>attempted to
prove him insane, that they might effect their purpose.&nbsp; For
a time he was influenced by the same desire.&nbsp; But to those
who visited him about this period, he never once alluded to a
desire to escape; but on the contrary, seemed almost always to
refer to his sentence without apparent emotion; and towards the
end, he appeared to long for, and to be earnest for its
completion.&nbsp; This state of mind was no doubt to be
attributed to two causes; in part, to a complete acquaintance
with the state of his own case, and to its final settlement by
his judges; but probably much more to his new state of religious
feeling; a sense of his own spiritual condition had begun to
swallow up every other consideration.</p>
<p>A friend had given him the second chapter of the Ephesians for
his consideration, that he might gain still further views of his
state of guilt and defilement, and that he might more clearly
trace both the power of Divine grace, by which the sinner is
quickened, and the bright prospect placed before those who seek
for pardon by the blood of Christ.&nbsp; The conversation of this
day led to the subjects contained in this chapter; and more
particularly to the impossibility of man&rsquo;s pardon, but by
the grace of God, through Christ Jesus.&nbsp; In the midst of a
statement of the hindrances in the way of salvation, from the
evil of our heart, the weakness of our best endeavours, and the
defilement of our services, Jolin remarked, &ldquo;I must put off
my sins.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was asked, what he meant by putting off
his sins.&nbsp; His answer manifested at once the simple, but
clear, manner in which he had received the Scripture illustration
pointed out to him the day before, and it was truly gladdening to
the feelings of his visitors: &ldquo;Did you not tell me
yesterday about the live goat on whose head the sins were
laid?&rdquo;&nbsp; The application of the type of the scape goat
had thus been made by him to his own state; and he had arrived at
the conviction, that, whatever might have been his sins, and
whatever were his hindrances, he was permitted to &ldquo;put them
all off,&rdquo; upon that all-sufficient atonement, the Lamb of
God, which taketh away the sins of the world.&nbsp; He had thus
been enabled to feel his burden, to bring it to the <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>cross of
Christ; and at once it seemed to have fallen from him at the feet
of his Redeemer.</p>
<p>The nature of faith is illustrated in a very interesting
manner, by the case of Jolin.&nbsp; The sinfulness of his own
state he knew, and felt deeply.&nbsp; He did not, however, seek
to excuse himself, or to palliate his offences: he did not think
that past services would be any compensation to God; that any
circumstance of his life or character would skreen him from
Almighty wrath; or that by repentance he might be pardoned
through the mere mercy of his Heavenly Father.&nbsp; In himself,
therefore, he had no ground of hope whatsoever: he was as a
debtor who had nothing to pay; as a sick man whose case was
desperate: but he felt an assurance that Christ was able to pay
his debt, and to cure his disease, and that in his own particular
case, he would do it; and he himself did in heart, what the high
priest did with his hands, transfer all his sins to the
atonement.&nbsp; Thus he came to feel, not indeed presumptuously,
but with confidence, that all his sins were laid upon the
sacrifice; and he was able to contemplate the Saviour&rsquo;s
mercies instead of his own merited doom as a sinner.&nbsp; The
ground of this assurance in his mind was an acceptance of the
simple testimony of God, that he would blot out his
transgressions.&nbsp; He believed in this word of promise, and
joy in believing was at once imparted to him.&nbsp; The
simplicity with which Jolin received the testimony of God in this
instance characterized his religious experience during the whole
of his remaining course.&nbsp; The Scriptures were as a message
of God to his soul.&nbsp; He received them as feeling there could
be no doubt but every word of them was true.&nbsp; I often, said
Mr. Hall, in the after part of his history, tried to persuade him
that it was, naturally speaking, an incredible thing that God
should have come in the flesh and atone for sin.&nbsp; But he
always said that he believed it, because it was so written in the
book which is the truth.</p>
<p>I have before noticed the indifference which Jolin appeared to
feel to outward circumstances.&nbsp; I have yet to observe
another point connected with it, in this day&rsquo;s visit, <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>which was the
brightness and almost cheerfulness of aspect that his manner and
countenance gradually assumed.&nbsp; In the period before his
condemnation, his downcast look and general air of wretchedness
were not unsuited to a state of despair; but now he lifted up his
head, and even his voice seemed to have changed its tone.&nbsp;
This surprising change was observed by others.&nbsp; Mr. Hammond,
Jolin&rsquo;s advocate, told M. Durell, as he himself has
recorded it, that when he saw the prisoner on the twenty-third of
September, he found him &ldquo;in really a distracted state, torn
by every conflicting passion, and all his faculties hurried by
the unutterable anguish of remorse.&nbsp; The dread of death was
uppermost in his thoughts; and there was nothing to which he
would not have submitted to avoid capital punishment: but when he
saw him again on the evening of the twenty-sixth, he was
astonished at the sudden change which had taken place in him: he
was calm, placid, and resigned, and he had not one wish to
live.&nbsp; I then,&rdquo; continues Mr. Durell, &ldquo;mentioned
to Mr. Hammond, that I had found him exactly in that state on my
first visit, the twenty-sixth, which had preceded his own only by
a few hours.&rdquo;&nbsp; He adds, &ldquo;the opinion of an
impartial and enlightened man, like Mr. Hammond, was certainly
very important: but M. de Quetteville, the mayor of the town, and
other laymen of the highest respectability, who had formerly
known the prisoner, had been equally struck with that great and
salutary change.&nbsp; From a comparison of dates,&rdquo; adds
Mr. Durell, &ldquo;I am inclined to believe, that his change must
not only have been rapid, but that his heart must have been
almost as instantaneously touched as that of the penitent
malefactor in the gospel.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now how was this wonderful
change to be accounted for?&nbsp; We read in Acts xvi. 34, that
when the keeper of the prison in Philippi had received St.
Paul&rsquo;s message, &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ,
and thou shalt be saved;&rdquo; that he &ldquo;took&rdquo; the
apostles &ldquo;<i>the same hour of the night</i>, and washed
their stripes;&rdquo; and was &ldquo;baptized,&rdquo; and
rejoiced believing in God.&nbsp; It was perhaps this very feeling
of joy which Jolin now experienced; <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>a joy which arose from a clear, full,
well-grounded belief in the doctrine of justification by
faith.&nbsp; This doctrine, which gives peace with God, is, when
rightly apprehended, attended with an experience of the love of
God shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Ghost, Rev. i. v., and
this necessarily brings joy with it.&nbsp; Thus, the man who has
been taught to look to him that justifieth the ungodly, is able
to walk in the light of God&rsquo;s countenance, and is
&ldquo;filled with all joy and peace in believing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the 25th, Jolin narrated to his visitor the whole history
of his melancholy life; his difficulties and discomforts,
arising, not so much from others, as from his own sinful, wilful
heart.&nbsp; Like many other young persons, he had chosen the way
of dissipation and folly, instead of that which many
circumstances had led him to think was a happier and a safer
course.&nbsp; It is indeed true, that his parents were not in a
state to check him in his proceedings; but he seems to have had
at many intervals those convictions of conscience which were
sufficient to have guarded him from the transgressions into which
he fell, and even to have guided him to seek the paths of
religion.&nbsp; His wretched education, however, came in aid of
his natural self-will, and soon confirmed him in those vices
which led to his ruin.</p>
<p>His state had been, as he himself described it, at times truly
miserable; but drinking had quickly expelled every conviction of
his own guilt, and he soon returned again to his mad
career.&nbsp; He observed to Mr. Durell, that since 1823, he had
not seen one happy week.&mdash;There are two things to observe on
these transient convictions of guilt in a state of
unconversion.&nbsp; Until the Spirit of God has enlightened the
heart, sin does not by any means, in all cases, appear as it had
appeared to Jolin, and as it invariably does to the renewed
heart, a grievous burden.&nbsp; The life of many wretched sinners
is one unbroken course of self-satisfaction.&nbsp; They are
described in the seventy-third Psalm, as often passing from their
cradles to their graves without a feeling of sorrow, or an
apprehension of <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>death.&nbsp; The Bible, however, teaches, that such a
state of unmixed prosperity is the most dangerous in which a man
can be placed; that the sinner, when thus left alone of God, is
lifted to that very slippery pinnacle from which he will fall to
his eternal ruin.&nbsp; Ministers cannot, therefore, press upon
their ungodly hearers the universal conviction of the misery
attending upon sin as an evidence of their unconverted state,
because sin does not in this life uniformly bring along with it
any such conviction.&nbsp; Their state of self-complacency is,
indeed, a state which comes as short of the real spiritual
happiness of the true Christian, as darkness does of light; but
it often affords a false peace, which perhaps does not leave the
sinner till his punishment begins, and the door of hope is shut
against him for ever.&nbsp; Another observation arising from
Jolin&rsquo;s feeling of wretchedness in his former state, is,
that the pain sometimes connected either with the practice of
sin, or a view of its consequences, will not, unassisted by the
Spirit of God, produce the real repentance which the Gospel
requires.&nbsp; It is true, the compunctions of conscience, like
the afflictions of life, are means often used to prepare the
sinner for the doctrines of the Gospel.&nbsp; Yet, in how many
cases do we find men wounded, but not contrite; stunned, but not
really affected by the deepest distresses of life.&nbsp; Thus we
learn, that it is not any mere dispensation of Providence which
necessarily brings men to that knowledge and faith which are
needful for salvation.&nbsp; It is true, that God does bless the
endeavours of the willing mind whenever he sees them; but the
mind is not necessarily made willing because it suffers, any more
than a child is necessarily made more compliant by the punishment
which is inflicted.&nbsp; Some substances harden whilst others
melt under the fire.&nbsp; Thus some souls are only confirmed in
sin by the events which are instrumental in recovering others
from it.&nbsp; For this he must be quickened by the power of God,
he must have an entirely different sense imparted to him from the
mere feeling of the misery of an evil course, or the afflictions
of life; he must be convinced of his own desperate state in the
sight of God, and <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>of the need of that sacrifice which the Saviour has
wrought out, before that good work is really begun, which, it is
promised, shall be carried on till the day of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;
So far, then, from the common notion, that the sufferings of our
life will atone for its offences, those sufferings have no
connexion whatever with our state hereafter, except as they may
have been a means of bringing us to seek that sacrifice by whom
alone any of our sins can be pardoned.</p>
<p>But to return to Jolin&rsquo;s history.&nbsp; In the visit of
the 25th, he was again led to a consideration of the only
sacrifice for man&rsquo;s transgression, particularly as it is
exhibited in the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah.&nbsp; In this
portion of Scripture he learnt more exactly the cause for which
Jesus Christ came on the earth, and became a man of sorrows, and
acquainted with grief:&mdash;&ldquo;Surely he hath borne our
griefs, and carried our sorrows.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He was
wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our
iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with
his stripes we are healed.&nbsp; All we like sheep have gone
astray: we have turned everyone to his own way; and the Lord hath
laid on him the iniquity of us all.&rdquo;&nbsp; Other passages
of Scripture, connected with this subject, and pointing out the
love of God as the first cause of man&rsquo;s salvation, were
also explained to him, as, Rom. v. 8, &ldquo;While we were yet
sinners, Christ died for us.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in connexion with
this, Ephes. ii. 4, 5, &ldquo;God, who is rich in mercy, for his
great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sin,
hath quickened us together with Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, Rom.
viii. 1, &ldquo;There is no condemnation to them that are in
Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the
Spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp; The being in Christ Jesus, and the nature of
faith, by which alone he could apply the merits and sufferings of
the Saviour, were now, as they were continually, dwelt upon.</p>
<p>The faith of the Gospel, he was more particularly taught, was
such a reception of the truths of Scripture, and more especially
of the engagement of God to pardon every sinner who came to him
in Christ Jesus, as led not only to an entire dependence upon
Christ, but to a complete <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>submission to his will, and a
consequent change in our own nature.&nbsp; It was not merely a
reception of the doctrine of faith, which was to be regarded as
faith in the soul, but the creation in the heart of a new and
animated feeling of trust in the Redeemer.&nbsp; The influence of
faith in the soul was like that of food to the body; it imparts a
new feeling and character; gives new nourishment and vigour, and
works by love, not only to the Saviour himself, but to all around
us.&nbsp; Faith, therefore, to be a living principle, must be
felt by ourselves, and must be seen by others: and of both these
points the faith of this young man gave ample proof.&nbsp; It
gave confidence to his own mind, and even gladdened his heart; it
made the Bible a new book to him; it cheered the solitude of his
prison; it directed him to be mindful of every practical duty; it
gave a new direction to all his hopes and fears, and enabled him
to go onwards in a spirit of filial dependence to meet the last
conflict.&nbsp; It was at this time, I think, that he made a
confession, which served to explain his previous state of mind,
and to show how remarkably his attention was fixed on one
point.&nbsp; &ldquo;How extraordinary, sir,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;it is, that for these last two days I have been able to
give my mind only to <i>one</i> subject; the thought of my crime
and of my death have been taken from me, and I have scarcely been
able to give my attention to either.&rdquo;&nbsp; The one subject
which occupied all his attention, and shut out every other, was
the love <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>of his Saviour, who had given himself for his
sins.&nbsp; This, as he said, &ldquo;filled his
heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; His state of mind served to show the
absorbing nature of this Divine principle when it is fully
implanted in the soul.&nbsp; When the mind has suddenly gained a
view of its former state of alienation, and has been brought nigh
again to God, it is impossible that the sense of this vast change
should not swallow up every other feeling.&nbsp; It is difficult
at all times to think much of God, and to think of any thing
else; but how much more, when the first conviction of the Divine
presence overwhelms the soul.&nbsp; And, as David, in the
fifty-first Psalm, appears to have comparatively lost sight of
his sin against his country, the family of Uriah, and of all the
consequences of it, in the depth of the feeling which he had of
his sin against God; so the love of Christ took possession of
Jolin&rsquo;s mind; and in its length, and breadth, and depth,
and height, so filled his thoughts, and so absorbed his soul,
that every other subject sank into nothing.</p>
<p>It will be manifest, that, in the explanation of all these
subjects, there was a constant repetition of points before
explained, and reference to many texts which are not
noticed.&nbsp; Jolin did not talk much; and indeed it was chiefly
in answer to a question, that he made any observation at
all.&nbsp; When a passage of Scripture was read to him, he would
often take the Bible and read it over slowly to himself, then
observe carefully whether a paper to mark it was so placed, that
he might find the place again, and return the book with some
slight expression of his feelings.&nbsp; In this way did he seem
to lay up portions of the Divine word, upon which he might
reflect in his solitary hours.&nbsp; His manner was always calm
and self-possessed; and his answers to questions were such as
showed that he clearly understood the grounds upon which the
answer was to be made.&nbsp; He was never beside the mark in a
reply.&nbsp; But it was quite evident that all the lessons which
were taught him, and which had the warrant of scriptural
authority, sank into his heart, and that he found in them that
which corresponded with his own experience.</p>
<p>The next day, the 26th, he was visited by Mr. Dallas, one of
the chaplains of the Bishop of Winchester, and by Mr. Durell, the
rector of St. Saviour&rsquo;s parish.&nbsp; These two clergymen
have each given public and repeated testimony to the state of
mind in which they found Jolin.&nbsp; The visit of Mr. Dallas was
chiefly occupied in an endeavour to search out the reality of the
foundation upon which the hope of the penitent rested, and he
viewed it as most satisfactory.&nbsp; Mr. Durell visited Jolin at
the request of the Dean of Jersey, in whose parish the prison is
situated.&nbsp; Mr. Durell says in his little work, &ldquo;I came
to perform <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>a difficult and unpleasant duty, which, indeed, I could
not refuse.&nbsp; I mention this indifference,&rdquo; he adds,
&ldquo;to show, that when I first repaired to this poor
man&rsquo;s dungeon, there must have been something very powerful
to have affected me to such a degree.&rdquo;&nbsp; He at first
brought Dodd&rsquo;s Prison Thoughts with him to read to Jolin;
but, on the suggestion of a friend, he changed this book for the
Bible.&nbsp; Mr. Durell visited Jolin many times: and he has
published an account of each visit.&nbsp; His remarks are candid,
kind, and very clear as to his belief of the real change of
Jolin&rsquo;s character.&nbsp; The facts which he narrates are
some of them in the highest degree interesting.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have sympathised,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;in Jolin&rsquo;s cell,
in all the horrors of his situation.&nbsp; I have shuddered at
his nefarious parricide; I have rejoiced in his unfeigned
repentance; and I have been soothed by his delightful
anticipations of a blessed immortality.&rdquo;&nbsp; He adds, on
one occasion, &ldquo;I never saw a man more free from
enthusiasm.&nbsp; All his religion centred in the atonement of
Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; On another, &ldquo;I never heard him
complain of the evidence against him, nor of his sentence; never
did an expression of murmur or of invective escape from
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; He says again, &ldquo;This visit lasted three
hours; than which none ever made a deeper impression on me, or
will perhaps be more conducive to my own spiritual
improvement.&rdquo;&nbsp; He adds again, &ldquo;It may, perhaps,
be supposed, that it was the dread of death which had excited his
religious fervour; on the contrary, those apprehensions ceased
from the moment that holy principle originated in his heart:
neither was it that instinctive fear of dying that drove him into
religious inquiries and self-examination.&nbsp; That fear may,
indeed, have caused a wicked man to be sorry for his sin; but the
growth in knowledge, in grace, and in so many gifts of the
Spirit, was so extraordinary and so unprecedented, that I cannot
account for it as having been the result of natural causes
operating on an ardent and distracted mind.&nbsp; I am not only
impartial, but am conscious that I am as free from superstition
and enthusiasm <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>as any man; yet I feel inwardly convinced, that
Jolin&rsquo;s conversation had something in it more than human;
and that Providence assisted him with an imperceptible, though
equally miraculous, working of the Holy Spirit; to the end that
his edifying repentance might operate like a distinguished
example to open the bosom of many an infidel to an examination of
the sacred truths of Christianity, and to persuade the
thoughtless and profligate, that, unless they abandon their
dangerous course, they will be doomed to certain
destruction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it may be interesting to lay before your readers the last
communication of this kind friend, when Jolin was about to be
executed.&nbsp; It was in a letter to one of the ministers then
with him in the prison.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">St. Saviour&rsquo;s,
Oct. 3, 1829, 9 o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&mdash;The deep, the Christian interest, which I
feel for our departing brother, induces me to write you a short
note.&nbsp; Tell him that I pray that the strength which is
imparted from on high may not fail him in his last hour, and that
the sufferings of the Saviour may inspire him with religious
courage to bear his sufferings.&nbsp; Tell him also, that since
we are not to meet again on earth, he departs with my blessing
and my prayers; and that, I trust, we shall meet again where
every tear shall be dried from every eye.&nbsp; The sixteenth
chapter of St. John is most particularly adapted to his awful
situation.&nbsp; The thirty-third verse is a glorious precept and
example for him: &lsquo;These things have I spoken to you, that
in me ye might have peace.&nbsp; In the world ye shall have
tribulation: but, be of good cheer, I have overcome the
world.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;I am, sir, yours truly,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">E. Durell</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the last Sunday of his life, Jolin had many visitors.&nbsp;
His mind seemed gradually to ripen for eternity.&nbsp; He gained
every day clearer views of his sinful nature, of the power of
Divine grace, of the nature of faith, of the immensity of the
love of Christ, and of the offer of a free <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>salvation
made to himself.&nbsp; He could now trace very distinctly, in the
various events of his life, the manifestations of the great mercy
of God in his favour.&nbsp; The returning prodigal (Luke xv.) he
felt more and more to represent himself and his own case.&nbsp;
He saw his heavenly Father waiting to be gracious to him.&nbsp;
He had scarcely time to offer up his supplications, when he
found, that before he called, God had answered, and while he was
yet speaking, He had heard.&nbsp; There was one circumstance
connected with the visit of this day which is, in itself,
striking.&nbsp; The last trial was to take place on the
morrow.&nbsp; He had, under the direction of his legal adviser,
prepared a paper, which was to be read to the jury.&nbsp; There
was still, therefore, a possibility of his escape from the
punishment of death.&nbsp; This latter circumstance became a
subject of conversation, and an earnest hope was expressed on the
part of his visitor, that, if he was set at liberty, he would be
supported by Divine grace, and that he would be enabled to live
to the glory of God.&nbsp; His answer to this observation clearly
showed how well he understood the power of the grace of God, and
how entirely his heart was stayed upon that as his only support
in every emergency of his life, whether he were to escape from
prison, or be led to the scaffold.&nbsp; He observed, &ldquo;Sir,
the man that is fit to <i>die</i>, is fit to <i>live</i>.&nbsp; I
have known what it is to have a heart as hard as a diamond; but I
now feel I have a heart of flesh.&rdquo;&nbsp; His persuasion was
thus very clearly expressed, that the same power which had
changed his heart from stone to flesh, could and would keep him
on his way; and that, depending upon Divine grace, he need not
fear whether life or death were presented to him.&nbsp; In this
calm and confiding posture of mind, he seemed continually to
rest.&nbsp; All his hope and trust were grounded on his
Saviour.&nbsp; He had come to the full experience of the
psalmist&mdash;&ldquo;It is good for me to draw near to
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A hymn of Cowper&rsquo;s, which had been given to him, seemed
very much to have arrested his attention this day.&nbsp; It is on
the subject of the fountain opened for sin, and for uncleanness.
(Zech. xiii. 1.)</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>&ldquo;There is a fountain filled with blood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Drawn from Immanuel&rsquo;s veins;<br />
And sinners plunged beneath that flood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lose all their guilty stains.</p>
<p>The dying thief rejoiced to see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That fountain in his day;<br />
And there have I, though vile as he,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wash&rsquo;d all my sins away.</p>
<p>E&rsquo;er since, by faith, I saw the stream<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy flowing wounds supply,<br />
Redeeming love has been my theme,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And shall be till I die.</p>
<p>Then, in a nobler, sweeter song,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll sing thy power to save,<br />
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lies silent in the grave.</p>
<p>Lord, I believe thou hast prepared<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (Unworthy though I be)<br />
For me a blood-bought free reward,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A golden harp for me.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis strung and tuned for endless years,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And formed by power divine,<br />
To sound in God the Father&rsquo;s ears,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No other name but thine.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This hymn he was very fond of, and he repeated it on his way
to the scaffold.&nbsp; It had been an object to store the mind of
Jolin with subjects which might, by the Divine blessing, be
sources of encouragement and of comfort to him when left alone
with his Bible, or in the silent hours of the night.&nbsp; The
following points, in addition to those already enumerated, had
been dwelt upon; and now, as the opportunities for visiting his
prison by the individual who proposed them, had drawn to a close,
some of them were at this time again earnestly pressed upon his
attention.&nbsp; These were, the &ldquo;tender mercy&rdquo; of
God, (Luke i. 78,) <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>by which alone the Day-spring from on high visits the
soul, and by which it is brought out of its state of natural
darkness; the view of Christ touched with the feeling of our
infirmities, (Heb. iv. 15, 16,) and encouraging us to go with
boldness to the Throne of grace; the invitation to ask with
importunity for the Holy Spirit (Luke xi. 1&ndash;11); the
intercession of Jesus for his people (Rom. viii. 34); the
promise, that God who had not spared his own Son would with him
freely give us all things (Rom. viii. 32); the remedy against all
trouble to be found in faith in the Lord Jesus Christ (John xiv.
1); the parting address and prayer of Christ (John xiv. xv. xvi.
xvii.); and the engagement that nothing shall separate the
believer from the love of Christ (Rom. viii. 35&ndash;39).&nbsp;
To this was added, as much examination as to the working of these
doctrines on his heart, the degree in which they were felt, and
their practical bearing, as the time and circumstances would
admit.&nbsp; All these subjects Jolin appeared to understand and
to receive; and if he could not enumerate them as distinct
articles of his religious creed, yet he seemed fully to
comprehend and to receive them as the testimony of God.</p>
<p>Monday, the 28th, was the day fixed for his second trial; and
here he exhibited the character of a real Christian.&nbsp; His
defence he had written before, and it was as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Gentlemen, whatever may be my fate, I shall
not die without having to reproach myself for not having quitted
my father&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; By so doing, I should have avoided
being the victim in different unhappy affairs that often took
place between my father and mother, in which I was generally the
object upon which the weight of their discontent fell.&nbsp; I
was often obliged to submit to being beaten most severely, and to
hear language unworthy of being uttered by either father or
mother.&nbsp; Now, left to myself in the solitude of a dungeon, I
reflect on times gone by, remembering that I was the only child,
abandoned to the most deplorable fate.&nbsp; Yet I ought to have
been wiser, and not followed the example of my nearer relations,
the source of my misfortune.&nbsp; But now that respectable
ministers of the Gospel have taken the trouble to visit me, and
<a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>point out
my duty towards God and towards man, I rest contented.&nbsp; I
pray to God to pardon the horrible, but never premeditated crime
of which I am guilty.&nbsp; If I ever had an intention of killing
my poor father, I had a very favourable opportunity of doing so,
when he was stretched upon a bed of sickness, unable to help
himself.&nbsp; I was then the only person who took care of him,
and administered to his wants, as there was no other person
besides myself in the house.&nbsp; I beg pardon of all those whom
I may have willingly or unwillingly offended.&nbsp; Gentlemen,
after this declaration, I submit myself entirely to your
wisdom.&nbsp; It is you who are going to decide my fate.&nbsp; I
am ready to meet it, and I will submit to your judgment without a
murmur.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ph. G. Jolin</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This paper is a translation from the French, in which language
it was originally written.&nbsp; Whether it is accurately
translated, or whether it was written by Jolin himself, or by his
advocate, it is impossible to judge.&nbsp; The passage in it
which relates to his parents, if his own, is liable to
objection.&nbsp; The faults of a parent, especially faults so
awfully punished, ought not to have made a part of his
defence.&nbsp; If the language is that of his advocate, it is
only the language of legal justification, and the facts are both
true and of much weight for the extenuation of his crime.</p>
<p>It is said, that during his trial, his calmness was
remarkable.&nbsp; His lips apparently were employed in prayer,
and this he afterwards confessed was the case.&nbsp; He prayed
for himself, that he might be strengthened to go through his
trial, and also for his judges and his jury.&nbsp; There was no
effrontery in his look; but, on the contrary, the appearance of
deep humiliation.&nbsp; For four hours, during which time his
trial lasted, he never lifted his eyes from the ground.&nbsp; On
his return from the trial, he had to encounter the indignation of
the populace against his crime.&nbsp; On the former occasion, a
woman had cried, &ldquo;Ah, le scelerat!&rdquo; which had a good
deal affected him.&nbsp; This time he addressed the people from
the prison gates, and when they observed that he was half dead
from fatigue, he said, amongst other things, &ldquo;I have a
strength within <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>me ye know not.&nbsp; This supports me.&nbsp; Weep not
for me, weep for yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the following days of his life, he received continual
visits from a variety of persons.&nbsp; On the 28th, the Rev. P.
Filluel; on the 29th, from both the chaplains of the Bishop of
Winchester; Mr. Dallas was indeed as assiduous in his attendance
at the gaol, as his many other duties at that time would permit;
and all these gentlemen expressed the strongest conviction of the
reality of Jolin&rsquo;s conversion.&nbsp; Many ministers, and
others beside, very kindly came, desiring to impart to him some
spiritual gift.&nbsp; He received all gladly; but more especially
those whose conversation led him to believe that they came to him
in the fulness of Christian love.&nbsp; His discernment on this
point was a striking evidence of the clear views of doctrine
which he had attained.&nbsp; He perceived and felt the inadequacy
of those religious systems which were not connected with deep and
experimental views of personal corruption; and with exclusive
dependence for salvation upon the atonement of Jesus
Christ.&nbsp; With a sense of gratitude for the instruments made
use of in awakening his mind, Jolin appeared remarkably
independent of any outward help.&nbsp; He was by no means like a
man who hung upon another&rsquo;s teaching, but upon that of
God.&nbsp; It was on this account that he was, perhaps, able to
bear without injury the multifarious instruction which he
received.&nbsp; His own language was most satisfactory; he always
spoke of the salvation procured for him as a free and unmerited
gift of God; and dwelt upon the peculiar manifestation of
God&rsquo;s grace to himself, inasmuch as he had twice saved him
from shipwreck when he was in an entirely unprepared state to
meet death, and now he had been brought to that prison that he
might learn the way of salvation.&nbsp; His expressions of the
sense of his own unworthiness were clear and strong.&nbsp; He
told one of his friends that he had nothing to offer to God, but
his heart; that all his repentance, all his resolutions, all his
short conflict with the carnal heart, could never expiate his
sin.&nbsp; On another occasion he said, that he was not worthy to
pick up the crumbs under his Master&rsquo;s table; and on
another, that Christ was his only hope; that <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>He had paid
his ransom, and that He would receive him into glory.&nbsp; With
another class of visitors, those of his family and friends, he
was equally decided in declaring what great things God had done
for his soul, and what necessity there was that they should turn
and repent if they would be saved.&nbsp; Indeed, a discourse of
this kind had made some of them think him insane.&nbsp; He had
told his relations who had come to him, that he was formerly
unclean and unholy; that they were so at that moment.&nbsp; He
therefore entreated them to apply to <i>Him</i> who had cast out
the unclean devils into the swine, to cleanse their souls.&nbsp;
On all occasions, when he could, he manifested the same desire to
instruct others, and lead them to that refuge which he had found
so precious to his own soul.</p>
<p>On Thursday, October 1, Mr. Durell records a very interesting
visit which he paid the prisoner: interesting, as it showed the
state of mind in which he found him.&nbsp; &ldquo;As we
approached the passage,&rdquo; says Mr. Durell, &ldquo;we could
hear the loud ejaculations of the prisoner&rsquo;s
prayers.&rdquo;&nbsp; The gaoler observed, that he always found
him thus employed when he was left alone in the cell.&nbsp; Mr.
Durell read to him the account of our Saviour&rsquo;s death, from
Matthew xxvii., and concluded with a prayer, at the end of which
Jolin was much affected.&nbsp; He exhibited, on this occasion,
the deepest sense of gratitude to all about him; and Mr. Hammond,
his advocate, who was also present, bore witness to the calmness
and the change of Jolin&rsquo;s state of mind.&nbsp; To the
latter gentleman, he, on that occasion, expressed his sense of
the great services rendered to him on his trial.&nbsp; He sat up
on his bed, and clasping both his hands together, said most
earnestly, &ldquo;Mr. Hammond, I thank you over and over again
for the pains you have taken for me.&nbsp; I regret that I have
nothing to give to reward you as you deserve.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
same sense of gratitude led him constantly to express his thanks
to his gaoler, whose kindness and attention, those who were so
often going out and in the prison can fully testify.&nbsp; But it
was not on this occasion alone, for the evidence afforded to his
state of mind was very remarkable.&nbsp; The acting
lieutenant-governor, <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>the dean, the mayor, a leading
medical man who came to inquire into his insanity, clergymen,
dissenting ministers, his advocate, his relations, his
attendants, all appear to have come away from the prison with a
common conviction, that the power of God had been at work in
producing the wonderful change which they witnessed.</p>
<p>On the day previous to his execution, the event to which I
have referred with regard to his relations occurred.&nbsp; They,
not understanding the nature of the change which had taken place
in him, and, judging from reports of blows which he had received,
and other circumstances, endeavoured to establish the plea of
insanity; and they brought a very eminent medical practitioner to
examine into his state.&nbsp; But this interference was followed
by the best consequences; for, whilst on the one hand it was
clearly ascertained that Jolin was in no state of derangement, or
delusion, or enthusiastic fervour; on the other, the clearest and
most satisfactory evidence was given of his real state of
mind.&nbsp; After this, the Dean of Jersey kindly attended to
administer the sacrament to him.&nbsp; Before he received the
holy communion, he underwent an examination; and to the dean, and
three other clergymen, he gave, in answer to their questions, a
reason of the hope that was in him.&nbsp; He explained with such
clearness the object and the nature of his faith, testified so
deep a sense of his own unworthiness, and showed so good a
feeling towards all his fellow-creatures, that they had not, any
of them, a doubt of his fitness to partake of the feast prepared
for the penitent sinner.&nbsp; This examination, which was
peculiarly solemn and affecting to Jolin, looking, as most of the
people of that island do, with deep veneration on the high and
sacred office of the dean, was remarkably calculated to detect
any thing which might be suspicious in his views, or in his real
state.&nbsp; Throughout this day, Mr. Hall reports, that Jolin
was longing to depart, and to be with Christ, saying, &ldquo;The
hours pass slowly.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was remarked that he must wait
God&rsquo;s time, who had yet work for him to do in his
vineyard.&nbsp; And most faithfully was every hour devoted <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>to the duties
of his immediate calling.&nbsp; He warned, rebuked, exhorted,
with all long-suffering and patience.&nbsp; He said he thought it
would be better for him to die on the scaffold, than quietly in
his cell, as he might thereby glorify God by his patience, and be
an example to all of the fatal consequences of indulgence in
sin.</p>
<p>Mr. Durell has given an account of his last visit to Jolin on
the evening of this day.&nbsp; He chose the same subject to read
to him as on the day before, but from another Evangelist.&nbsp;
It was Luke xxiii., the account of our Saviour&rsquo;s
crucifixion.&nbsp; During the reading, Jolin&rsquo;s sensibility
was greatly excited, and his half-broken sobs were heard.&nbsp;
Mr. Durell, thinking it proper to check this state of mind,
pointed out the sufferings of Christ as a matter of holy joy, and
threatened to lay down the book, and read no more, if Jolin
continued to feel so much.&nbsp; Mr. Durell, wishing to avoid any
thing which might discompose Jolin, carefully omitted making any
comment on the most affecting part of our Saviour&rsquo;s
sufferings.&nbsp; He, on the other hand, sought to comfort him by
an application of the promise, that &ldquo;they who sow in tears,
shall reap in joy;&rdquo; and by the prospect of paradise held
out to the penitent thief.&nbsp; He adds, in conclusion,
&ldquo;In the course of my profession, I have seen many
individuals on the brink of the grave; but never before did I
witness such coolness and such self-command&mdash;a scene so
holy, so edifying, so sublime.&nbsp; Had he been in the full
bloom of human prosperity, and with the prospect of adding half a
century longer to his existence, he could not have been more
collected.&nbsp; I was myself almost falling into a delusion
contrary to the evidence of my own senses.&nbsp; I could not
believe that one so near his end could retain so much courage, or
such contempt of ignominy and death.&nbsp; I could not believe
that one so gentle, and now so well instructed in religious
duties, could have been ever capable of committing a crime for
which he deserved to die&mdash;that he could have been a
murderer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the night previous to his execution, the kind relation who
had first visited him in the prison, and brought him <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>the first
message of salvation, in bringing him the New Testament, and Mr.
Gallachin, an excellent minister of the church, sat up with
him.&nbsp; They endeavoured to sing a hymn, and, feeling the
imperfection of the service, he said, &ldquo;To-morrow I shall
join in very different singing from this.&rdquo;&nbsp; At
half-past one in the morning, he fell into a kind of dozing
stupor for an hour, but did not sleep.&nbsp; During that time he
was heard repeating the fifty-first Psalm, and also repeatedly
exclaiming, &ldquo;Glory to the Lamb! glory to our Lord Jesus
Christ!&rdquo; and when he awoke, he said that he had seen
glorious things in a dream.&nbsp; He also said, between sleeping
and waking, as it appeared, &ldquo;There is now, therefore, no
condemnation for them that are in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; At
waking he requested that a hymn might be sung.&nbsp; The next
morning Mr. Hall went to him at half-past six
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; When he entered his cell, Jolin said,
&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Hall, I am so glad to see you; I am so
happy.&nbsp; I have slept four hours, and the rest of the night
we have spent in such delightful conversation.&nbsp; I feel so
strong, but I will wait patiently the Lord&rsquo;s
time.&rdquo;&nbsp; The day before, I have observed, he thought
the hours passed slowly, he was so anxious to depart and to be
with Christ.&nbsp; Mr. Hall took occasion to warn him, that he
had still a work to do.&nbsp; He must not only glorify his
Saviour by his conduct, and by his patient resignation, but he
must again speak a word of warning to those about him.&nbsp; And
he assured him that he might be able to do more for the praise
and honour of his Master in his death upon the scaffold, by
bearing testimony to his own exceeding wickedness, and to the
unsearchable mercy and love of Christ, than if he had died in a
more private manner.&nbsp; To this he assented, and took the
resolution of doing all in his power.&nbsp; &ldquo;Great,
indeed,&rdquo; says Mr. Hall, &ldquo;were the grace and support
which he enjoyed.&nbsp; He felt sick at breakfast time, and could
not eat; but, to oblige me, he said he would try.&nbsp; About
nine o&rsquo;clock his irons were taken off; and I could not help
thinking of this as symbolical of that liberty which soon, when
passed beyond this life, he would enjoy for ever in the presence
of his <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>Saviour.&nbsp; Jolin immediately proposed to me to kneel
down and thank God for what he had done for him; saying, &lsquo;I
have always before prayed in bed; now I can go on my knees in the
proper posture for a sinner.&rsquo;&nbsp; Oh, at this time, how
deep were his confessions of sin, committed both in thought,
word, and deed; his acknowledgment of mercy through Jesus Christ;
his expressions of dependence upon Him for grace, to keep him in
his fiery trial, and to open for him the kingdom of heaven!&nbsp;
When he drank his milk, he said, &lsquo;Oh! God, I thank thee
that thou hast been so merciful and good to me, who have been so
great a sinner!&rsquo;&nbsp; His hand was never cold, and his
pulse was always regular to the end.&nbsp; I never witnessed one
to whom the Lord was pleased to give a stronger faith, which was
proved by his conduct to the last.&nbsp; He sat calmly speaking
and listening till about half-past twelve; when he left the
prison, leaning on me and Mr. Gallachin.&nbsp; An immense
concourse of people presented itself at the prison gates, and
their rush and noise were greater than we expected.&nbsp; The
newspaper account says&mdash;&lsquo;He was calm and collected,
walked with steadiness, and evinced throughout the most decorous
firmness.&nbsp; We could not perceive that he trembled.&nbsp; His
mind seemed quite absorbed in religious exercises; and, from all
we can learn, there was good and satisfactory evidence that he
was a true penitent, and relied on the Divine
mercy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he was leaving the gaol he was heard to repeat the fourth
verse of the twenty-third Psalm, &ldquo;Yea, though I walk
through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil;
for thou art with me, thy rod and thy staff they comfort
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Hall continues: &ldquo;The noise of the
people prevented my being heard by Jolin, who walked as firmly as
myself: I therefore opened my hymn-book, and pointed out to him
the sufficiency of the Redeemer, in one of those hymns which I
had previously chosen for his perusal.&nbsp; The hymn chosen was
one beginning&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;He lives, the great Redeemer lives!<br />
What joy the blest assurance gives!<br />
<a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>And now,
before his Father, God,<br />
Pleads the full merit of his blood.</p>
<p>In every dark, distressful hour,<br />
When sin and Satan join their power,<br />
Let this dear hope repel the dart,<br />
That Jesus bears us on his heart.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;He told me, that he did not mind the people, that they
were poor worms; that he would endeavour to warn them from the
scaffold, for they were standing on the brink of the pit.&nbsp;
We mounted the steepest part of the gallows hill.&nbsp; He said,
his Saviour had toiled up Calvary with a cross, which he ought to
be thankful that he had not to bear; and that Jesus Christ had
done this for <i>his</i> sake, whereas, he was receiving the due
reward of his transgression.&nbsp; This reflection seemed to give
new wings to his exertions in pressing up the rock.&nbsp; I think
that a worse place of ascent could not have been chosen.&nbsp;
When we arrived at the summit, the Greffier read his sentence
aloud, and Mr. Gallachin prayed most fervently with him in
French.&nbsp; After the prayer, he ascended the platform with Mr.
Gallachin and myself, and addressed the people in French, as you
will see by the account in the newspaper.&nbsp; But the account
is deficient in one most essential point.&nbsp; He urged the
people by the <i>love</i> of <i>Christ</i>, whom he had
crucified, and whom they were crucifying by their
sins.&rdquo;&nbsp; The substance of his warning was on the
subject of intemperance, Sabbath-breaking, the neglect of God and
of religion; and it was addressed principally to parents and to
the young.&nbsp; These warnings he twice delivered; once before,
and once after the rope was fastened round his neck.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Although I do not accurately remember,&rdquo; Mr. Hall
continues, &ldquo;the words of any of his speeches, I can safely
say, that he expressed his conviction that the work which had
taken place in his heart had been effected by no power or will of
his own, but by a sovereign act of Divine grace.&nbsp; Jolin then
read aloud some verses from the Testament, which sufficiently
indicate the view which <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>he took both of the nature of his
change, and of the source from whence it sprang.&nbsp; They are
taken from 1 Pet. i. 3&ndash;5: &lsquo;Blessed be the God and
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant
mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope, by the
resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance
incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved
in heaven for you, who are kept by the power of God through faith
unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last
time.&rsquo;&nbsp; To these verses he was particularly
partial.&nbsp; He then spoke to me, and told me that he had full
confidence in the sufficiency of the blood of Christ to blot out
all his sins; and that He who had loved him so much as to shed
his blood for him, and had kept him to that hour stedfast and
immoveable, would receive him into glory.&nbsp; When the cap was
drawn over his face, I told him not to dread the momentary pain,
for soon he would be in the presence of his Saviour.&nbsp; He
pressed my hand, and said he was not afraid; for he knew that He
would take him unto himself.&nbsp; I told him that I would pray
that his sufferings might be short, and went down.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mr. Gallachin then read a part of the Burial Service, until the
fatal moment.&nbsp; His sufferings appeared not to be great, and
were of brief duration.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whilst I was in
prayer,&rdquo; Mr. Hall adds, &ldquo;the drop fell, and our poor
brother I knew had entered into the presence of his
Redeemer.&nbsp; The women around me screamed out, &lsquo;The Lord
have mercy upon his poor soul!&rsquo;&nbsp; I could not but pray
that their souls might find the same mercy.&nbsp; He died without
a struggle.&nbsp; I never saw him after I pressed his hand when
alive, as I ascended the hill through the crowd, and was spared
seeing his mortal remains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus ended the course of a young man, whose history is a
solemn memorial, not only of the awful effects of a bad
education, and of the wretchedness of sin, but also of the
wonderful compassion of God.&nbsp; Much of what has been narrated
may appear almost incredible to some readers; and many of those,
especially, who are justly suspicions of death-bed repentances,
may be led to doubt <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>how far the work of this young man&rsquo;s conversion
was complete, and whether, if he had been permitted to live, he
would have lived as he has died.&nbsp; If, however, he was really
converted in heart to God, the observation which he himself made
must be applied to his own case: &ldquo;The man that is fit to
die is fit to live.&rdquo;&nbsp; The same grace which brought him
into the fold of Christ would have kept him in all his way; so
that the enemy of his soul should not have overpowered him.&nbsp;
And there is, as before mentioned, the most remarkable
concurrence of testimony as to Jolin&rsquo;s state at the time of
his death.&nbsp; Not only Mr. Hall, Mr. Gallachin, and many
others, bear witness to the facts; but the public voice has
acknowledged the wonderful change which took place in him.&nbsp;
One person, <i>not</i> a believer in revelation, but who stood by
Jolin on the gallows hill, and witnessed his conduct, came to a
minister, and acknowledged, that &ldquo;there must be something
in religion to support a man in such a manner; and that he had
therefore determined to attend a place of worship, and to bring
up his children in the fear of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Hall says,
&ldquo;I have never had a doubt on my mind as to the reality of
the change.&nbsp; His conduct in the court; his complete deadness
to the things of time and sense, and this even when his friends
seemed so anxious to save him from an ignominious death, were so
many pleasing testimonies that he was really risen with Christ,
and that his affections were set upon things above.&nbsp; God did
indeed work mightily in him: though last, he was one of the
first.&nbsp; He seemed so convinced of sin, and to have such
simple dependence upon the truth and firm foundation of
Christ&rsquo;s promises, and he showed so abundantly that these
feelings were not merely talked into his head, that I always
returned delighted with my visit to him.&nbsp; I used to pray
instantly with him that he might not be deceiving himself, nor be
deceived by Satan, or any of us; and I can say, as far as I was
capable of judging, that his was a real work of Divine
grace.&rdquo;&nbsp; The testimony of the editor of the Jersey
newspaper, also, while it is beyond all suspicion of enthusiasm,
and does not even exhibit the proof of a <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>tolerably
distinct view of the real foundation on which Jolin stood, is a
most satisfactory testimony of the reality of this change.&nbsp;
He says, &ldquo;We are not amongst those who would hastily give
credence to the genuineness of conversion in the cases of great
criminals, or who approve of religious ecstasies in the short
interval between the commission of dreadful enormities, and the
violent death awarded by law; we do not think it desirable that,
while so many good men, after a long life of exemplary piety,
approach their last hour with solemn apprehensions, such as have
lived in a course of profligate vice should boast of triumphant
feelings and peculiar joy on their way to the scaffold, where
they are to be suddenly compelled into the presence of their
Creator and Divine Judge;&mdash;but, in the instance before us,
we have much satisfaction in believing that a real change of
heart had taken place, before a change of worlds was
experienced.&nbsp; In his last days, Jolin evinced much solidity
of mind on the subject most important to him: his conduct was
marked by the most becoming propriety; and if he expressed a
confident hope of acceptance before God, it was accompanied with
humility, and, as far as man can judge, with sincere sorrow for
his offences.&rdquo;&nbsp; The rapid attainment of Divine
knowledge, the simple belief of the truths of the Bible, the
consistent walk in that which he believed to be the will of God,
are fruits which can be ascribed only to the grace and Spirit of
God.&nbsp; Where the Lord of all power and might is pleased to
exercise his sovereignty, who shall say that the work of many
years may not be produced in a few weeks; or, as in the case of
the thief upon the cross, in a much shorter time?&nbsp; The case
of the thief on the cross is one in which the probabilities,
before-hand, of repentance, were not so great; and the evidences
of his real conversion are scarcely more complete, except the
incidental circumstance of the testimony of our Lord.&nbsp; Both
of these criminals felt sorrow for their sins, confessed them to
men, acknowledged them to God, and owned the justice of their
condemnation; both testified the sincerity of their <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>faith: but,
if the thief did this under circumstances more trying to his
sincerity than those of Jolin, it is also to be remembered, that
he saw the Lord of life; and that to Jolin alone, therefore, the
language applied, &ldquo;Blessed are they that have not seen, and
yet have believed.&rdquo;&nbsp; I know of no mark of true
conversion which was absent from the case of Jolin.&nbsp; His
faith was clear and strong.&nbsp; It lifted him above the world,
and, wrought by love, it gave him courage, and zeal, and
love.&nbsp; He went forward in implicit dependence upon Divine
grace, and pursued, as was permitted him after his change, a
holy, humble, consistent course; and, with the cap upon his head,
and the rope round his neck, he could say with calmness, that
&ldquo;he was not afraid, for he knew that his Saviour would take
him to himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it may still be said, How do we know that Jolin was
sincere in all that he said, or that he was not under delusion in
what he felt?&nbsp; To this question the reply has been, I think,
already offered in these pages&mdash;by pointing to the workings
of his mind, and the consistency of his conduct.&nbsp; And here
we must leave the case till the last great day.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, let us learn from this history, some of the
lessons which it is calculated to teach.</p>
<p>The first of these is, the <i>misery and danger of a state of
sin</i>.&nbsp; St. Paul, in describing the consequences of a
state of sin, says, in an appeal to the Roman converts, (vi. 21,)
&ldquo;What part had ye then in those things whereof ye are now
ashamed; for the end of those things is death.&rdquo;&nbsp; That
is, sin yields no real <i>fruit</i>; it produces shame; and the
end of it will be <i>death</i>.&nbsp; Every Christian feels the
truth of this statement, as respects himself; and it is the case
with all other men, although they know it not.&nbsp; What, for
instance, is the usual fruit of drunkenness? disease,
quarrelling, and loss of one kind or another.&nbsp; The drunkard
is usually a blasphemer, hard-hearted, and cruel, as he proves
himself to his wife and children, starving or ill-treating them
to gratify his own lust.&nbsp; His habits of drunkenness make him
a bad child, a bad neighbour, a disgrace in himself, and a plague
to others.&nbsp; So it is more or less <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>with the followers of every
sin.&nbsp; Sin, then, brings no real fruit, and the end of it
will be eternal death; for it is written, &ldquo;The wicked shall
be turned into hell, and all the people that forget
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;As surely, therefore, as a man sows, so
shall he also reap; he that soweth to the flesh, shall of the
flesh reap corruption.&rdquo;&nbsp; How awful is the history of
Jolin&rsquo;s father!&nbsp; His life how disgraceful, his death
how dreadful!&nbsp; Would the sinner who reads this be content to
come to such an end?&nbsp; But to this, in his present state, he
is every moment liable.&nbsp; Let the sinner remember, that he
who called this poor wretch to judgment at a moment&rsquo;s
warning, may say to himself, &ldquo;This night thy soul is
required of thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; The probability of thus dying is
commonly passed over; and it is the hope of a sinner that he
shall still live to repent, as Jolin did.&nbsp; Yet how great are
the chances against this!&nbsp; Many a man has been deluded by
such a hope, and perished in his transgression.&nbsp; He has
looked to some case like this, or like that of the thief on the
cross, and delayed his repentance, till, in an hour when he has
not looked for it, he has been &ldquo;driven away in his
wickedness.&rdquo;&nbsp; But in this, as it is said by an old
writer, &ldquo;The perverseness of our nature may be seen, in
that this one case, that of the penitent thief, serveth us to
looseness of life, in hope of the like: whereas, we might better
reason, that is <i>but</i> one, and that extraordinary; and
besides this one, there is not one more in all the Bible; and
that for this one that sped, a thousand thousands have
missed.&nbsp; And what folly it is to put ourselves in a way in
which so many have miscarried; to put ourselves in the hands of a
physician, that hath murdered so many, going clean against our
own sense and reason!&nbsp; Whereas, in other cases we always
lean to that which is most ordinary, and conclude not the spring
from <i>one</i> swallow.&nbsp; It is as if a man should spur his
ass till he speak, because Balaam&rsquo;s ass did once speak; so
grossly hath the devil bewitched us!&rdquo;&nbsp; Let sinners,
then, meditate upon their own state, and remember, at the same
time, the appeal of the Almighty to them to <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>turn again
and repent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have I any pleasure at all that the
wicked should die? saith the Lord God: and not that he should
return from his ways and live?&nbsp; Repent and turn yourselves
from all your transgressions, so iniquity shall not be your
ruin.&nbsp; Cast away from you all your transgressions, and make
you a new heart and a new spirit; for why will ye die, O house of
Israel?&nbsp; For I have no pleasure in the death of him that
dieth, saith the Lord God: wherefore turn yourselves, and live
ye.&rdquo; (Ezek. xviii.)&nbsp; That text which first appeared to
move Jolin to repentance, may speak to every other
sinner&mdash;&ldquo;Come now, and let us reason together, saith
the Lord.&nbsp; Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be
white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as
wool.&rdquo; (Isa. i. 18.)&nbsp; The same words of encouragement
may also speak to us, in the language of a merciful Saviour,
&ldquo;I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to
repentance.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Matt. ix. 13.)&nbsp; The same promises,
&ldquo;God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten
Son, that whosoever believeth on him, should not perish, but have
everlasting life:&rdquo; and again, &ldquo;There is joy in the
presence of the angels of God over one sinner that
repenteth,&rdquo; (Luke xv. 10.)&nbsp; I would say then, again,
in the language of Peter, &ldquo;Repent ye therefore, and be
converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of
refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A second point of consideration in this history is <i>the
conversion of Jolin&rsquo;s mind to a sense of religion</i>,
<i>and the nature of his conversion</i>.&nbsp; Jolin&rsquo;s
early education, as far as reading and writing, had not been
altogether neglected; and the daily misery his sins brought with
them was not without its effect on his mind.&nbsp; But it is
evident the work of regeneration, the first step in his after
conversion, had not taken place before he came into prison.&nbsp;
But when the Holy Spirit brought home the word of God to his
heart, the change was rapidly effected.&nbsp; A conviction of the
sinfulness of his nature and habits was at once deeply impressed
upon his conscience; he waited to see the way of <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>pardon by a
crucified Redeemer, and the influence of the Holy Ghost
immediately produced that change in his will and affections which
always attends real conversion.&nbsp; His whole state of mind
seemed almost miraculously changed: so that between the
twenty-third and the twenty-sixth of the same month, in the
judgment of his legal adviser and others, a complete renovation
had taken place.&nbsp; In the former state he is described as in
a distracted condition of mind, suffering unutterable anguish;
the dread of death being uppermost in his thoughts: in the
latter, he was calm, placid, resigned, and he had not one wish to
live. <a name="citation45"></a><a href="#footnote45"
class="citation">[45]</a></p>
<p>Although it would be contrary to the facts and spirit of
Scripture to say, that no conversions of this kind were real and
complete, every one must acknowledge, that as conversion is
ordinarily a gradual work, too much caution cannot be exercised
as to a change accomplished as rapidly as this may appear to have
been.&nbsp; It may, however, be truly said, that there was a
remarkable absence of any thing like enthusiasm in his
state.&nbsp; A dream which occurred in the commencement of his
religious course will not be conceived to indicate a disordered
imagination.&nbsp; For some nights he had been dreadfully
agitated, and could not rest.&nbsp; &ldquo;I dreamed,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;that I was dragged over frightful precipices, till
at last I was brought, as it were, into the presence of our
Saviour, and there obtained mercy.&rdquo;&nbsp; This dream so
harmonized with the spirit of many passages of Scripture pointed
out to him, that it was not unlikely to occur.&nbsp; In his case,
as in every other, the first touch of religion on the soul was
immediate; but the after stages of conversion were
gradual&mdash;far more so than many others recorded in Scripture;
and there was time to perceive the regular progress of growth in
grace.&nbsp; This case, therefore, should not be confounded with
what are commonly called instantaneous conversions, because
although compressed into a short period every step of scriptural
conversion may be traced in it.&nbsp; From first to last, Jolin
was able to give a reason for the <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>hope which was in him, and these
reasons corresponded with the feelings and convictions described
in the word of God.&nbsp; He felt those convictions of sin on
which Scripture insists.&nbsp; He found, agreeably also to
Scripture, nothing in his own state upon which he could depend
for salvation; and, relying entirely on the merits of the Lord
Jesus Christ, he found peace and joy in believing.&nbsp; In this
manner, if his conversion proceeded rapidly, it was not wanting
in any of those evidences which are the unquestioned fruits of
the teaching of God.&nbsp; His conduct is the best, and indeed
the only satisfactory commentary on the whole work.</p>
<p>A third point worthy of consideration in the history of Jolin,
is, <i>the means</i> by which it pleased God <i>to open this
young man&rsquo;s mind</i>; and this, I may venture to affirm,
was <i>the Holy Scriptures</i>.&nbsp; It was the simple
exhibition of the fifty-first Psalm, which at first seemed to
expose his real state to him.&nbsp; It was the promises of the
New Testament, and the types of the Old, which gave him his first
clear notion of faith, and which conveyed to his mind a hope of
pardon.&nbsp; The Scripture then became the subject of his
meditation day and night.&nbsp; It was as a &ldquo;lamp unto his
feet, and a light unto his path; a treasure more to be desired
than gold, yea, than much fine gold; sweeter also than honey, and
the honeycomb.&rdquo;&nbsp; The value of Scripture arising from
its clearness, authority, and its peculiar power, under God, to
fasten truth on the soul, are remarkably conspicuous in the case
of this guilty person.&nbsp; He heard, marked, learned, and
inwardly digested its all-important truths, and they made him
wise unto salvation.&nbsp; But in connexion with this, and every
other means employed, is to be noticed the <i>influence of Divine
grace</i>.&nbsp; The Almighty power and sovereignty with which
this was exercised, was frequently acknowledged, and continually
felt by Jolin.&nbsp; He perceived it in all the remarkable
circumstances of his life&mdash;in his various escapes from
death&mdash;in his final allotment&mdash;in the events which
occurred in the prison.&nbsp; And whilst all this distinguishing
mercy was shown towards him, he could discover nothing in himself
<a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>which
deserved any such remembrance at God&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; Why was
he called, and not his father, was one of the points which first
struck his attention on the visit of his friends.&nbsp; But to
those around him some other circumstances, illustrating this
influence, were perhaps more obvious than even to himself.&nbsp;
The manner in which he was enabled to receive the truths of the
gospel; the gift of spiritual understanding; the willing heart;
the subdued spirit, and sanctified heart, were all circumstances
to be referred only to the sovereign grace of Him who worketh in
his people to will and to do of his good pleasure.&nbsp;
&ldquo;O, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and
knowledge of God!&nbsp; How unsearchable are his judgments, and
his ways past finding out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A fifth lesson to be learned from this history, is the
<i>benefit of education</i>.&nbsp; Here was a young man most
unlikely to profit from the early instruction he had received;
and to what account did it turn?&nbsp; In his worst times he was
enabled to read the word of God, and this he was led to do in the
tediousness of his sea watches.&nbsp; In his imprisonment, the
blessings of his previous learning was incalculable.&nbsp; In his
last exhortations on the scaffold, he pressed upon his youthful
auditors the advantages of attendance upon a Sunday school, and
the public means of instruction.&nbsp; It is impossible to say
how much, or if any of the preparatory work of religion, had, by
means of education, been going on in Jolin&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp;
But information had been given&mdash;a desire for instruction had
been implanted&mdash;the wretchedness of a sinful course had been
taught&mdash;the Scriptures had been read&mdash;the scaffolding,
in fact, had been put together, by which the future edifice might
be erected.&nbsp; How striking is the lesson of encouragement
derived from this history, to those who are labouring in the
school or in the prison.&nbsp; Who could have thought that in
either case, as it concerned Jolin, the event would have been
what it was?&nbsp; But who knows what the most untractable child
may yet become, or how far the seed which is sown, may, even a
long time hence, produce the desired fruit.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the
morning sow thy seed, and in the <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>evening withhold not thine hand, for
thou knowest not whether shall prosper either this or that, or
whether they shall both be alike good.&rdquo;&nbsp; We may, in
our efforts to instruct, meet with many disappointments, but it
is plainly our duty to proceed, with becoming care indeed, but in
the remembrance both of God&rsquo;s almighty power to teach the
heart, and of instances, such as this, in which that power has
been so remarkably exerted.&nbsp; The state of prisoners is one
which invites, as it has in general received the peculiar
commiseration of our countrymen: men are often to be found there
in Jolin&rsquo;s state of mind.&nbsp; The prison is, perhaps,
their first resting-place in a career of ignorance, and sin, and
misery.&nbsp; The visitor may too often, in his researches,
discover the man, as Mr. Pinel did Jolin, &ldquo;without hope for
this world or the next,&rdquo; and may lead him to discoveries of
what, perhaps, never entered his imagination.&nbsp; At all
events, the circumstances of trial and affliction are those most
favourable to seriousness of reflection; and this is the course
by which the sinner is most often led, by the grace of God, to
turn from the error of his ways, and to seek the hope offered in
the Gospel.&nbsp; The event is always in the hand of Him who
directs the heart.&nbsp; But, under all circumstances, we work
with the blessing of the Almighty, and with his promise, that our
labour shall not be in vain.</p>
<p>A sixth lesson to be learned from this history, is the
<i>happy effects produced by the possession of true
religion</i>.&nbsp; In the case of Jolin, how speedily did it
tranquillize and cheer his mind.&nbsp; It was like the word of
its holy author, when he said, &ldquo;Peace, be still, and there
was a great calm.&rdquo;&nbsp; Those who visited the chamber of
death, where he dwelt, could not but feel a degree of surprise at
their own feelings, when they remembered that they were with one
who had been a drunkard and a murderer.&nbsp; But religion had
softened his character, and created in him those genuine fruits
which, as we are taught, spring from the work of the Holy
Spirit.&nbsp; &ldquo;The wilderness had become like Eden, and the
desert like the garden of the Lord.&nbsp; Instead of the thorn
had come up the fir-tree, <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>and instead of the briar had come up
the myrtle-tree; to be for a name, and for an everlasting sign
that should not be cut off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lastly, there <i>is a lesson of application to our own
souls</i>.&nbsp; It may be asked, What is the intimate
acquaintance which we have had with the experience which this
poor dying criminal passed through?&nbsp; He, being dead, may
speak to many of his own age, who have, perhaps, had far greater
advantages of education and example; or he may speak to those who
have seen more years, and yet have not attained to that ripeness
of faith, and that full assurance of hope, which made Jolin climb
with such eagerness the gallows hill, and long for the time when
he should be with Christ.</p>
<p>This history applies most emphatically to the case of <i>young
men</i>; teaching them to avoid sin, even when it may have the
sanction of parental example.&nbsp; The Bible, they must
remember, and not men, especially ungodly men, should be their
direction.&nbsp; By this law we shall all be judged, and must
stand or fall.&nbsp; In Jolin&rsquo;s last address, he said,
&ldquo;Avoid bad company, drinking spirits, vicious
habits.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I exhort young people not to violate
the Sabbath, but to frequent church, and attend to their
religious duties.&nbsp; Would that this tremendous example of
punishment might lead every young person who hears it to inquire
into his own state, and to remember how soon one act of sin may
bring judgment upon him; and how tremendous will be his judgment,
if, after this warning, he is found unprepared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This history also speaks most loudly and awfully <i>to
parents</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see in me,&rdquo; Jolin said from
the scaffold, &ldquo;the effect of bad education and
example.&nbsp; From early youth I have been addicted to
intemperance.&nbsp; My duty to God was never pointed out to
me.&nbsp; Those who have children committed to their care, I
beseech to send them regularly to church, and to the
Sunday-school, and teach them their duty to God and
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let those, then, who are teaching
Sabbath-breaking, swearing, passion, habits of drinking and vice,
to their children, by their own example, <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>look at the
horrible instance of sin and its consequences, which this case
presents&mdash;a parent, murdered, and a son hanged! from the
<i>effects of a father&rsquo;s example</i>!&nbsp; The case speaks
for itself: and may the Holy Spirit enable us to learn the lesson
which it teaches.</p>
<p>May we all who read or hear this account, apply its lessons to
ourselves.&nbsp; Let us adore the astonishing love of God in the
case of this poor outcast sinner; His sovereign power, His
boundless mercy, His all-sufficient grace.&nbsp; May we seek to
lay all the burden of our transgressions upon that Sacrifice in
whom Jolin trusted.&nbsp; May we, with him, find the Holy Spirit
making us as fit to live, as, we trust, he was fit to die: so
that when we have fought the good fight, we shall receive the
crown of glory, which, we may trust, this believing penitent has
been called to wear in the presence of Him who gave him the
victory, through his own blood.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
